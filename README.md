# python-terrafile

Manages external Terraform modules, controlled by a `Terrafile`.

This is basically a Python version of the tool described at [http://bensnape.com/2016/01/14/terraform-design-patterns-the-terrafile/](http://bensnape.com/2016/01/14/terraform-design-patterns-the-terrafile/)

## Installation

```shell
pip install terrafile
```

## Usage

```shell
pterrafile [path]
```

If `path` is provided, it must be the path to a `Terrafile` file, or a directory containing one. If not provided, it looks for the file in the current working directory.
